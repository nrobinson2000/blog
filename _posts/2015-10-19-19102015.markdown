### Updates:
* I added a sidebar menu on the front page of my Blog.  It has information about my Blog and links to its source code and the Jekyll website.  I created a new css class in the `css/main.scss` file for the sidebar.  Here's a snippet of it's CSS.
{% highlight scss %}
.side-nav {
    line-height:25px;
    height:300px;
    width: -webkit-calc(50% - (#{$spacing-unit} / 2));
    float:right;
    padding:15px;
}
{% endhighlight %}
I added a `nav_message` field in `_config.yml`.  Whatever HTML I put into it is displayed in the nav bar on the front page.  
{% highlight html %}
<nav class="side-nav">
[[ site.nav_message ]]
</nav>
{% endhighlight %}
***NOTE:*** *I have used `[ ]` here to represent `{ }` because using `{ }` replaces the text with `site.nav_message`.*


* I updated the `particle.svg` icon in the footer so its now in a circle.  I had to use Inkscape and change the SVG code.  Magnified, it looks like this.
<center><img src="/images/particle.svg" width="100px" height="100px"></center>
