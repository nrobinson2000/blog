#Todo:
#### Finish writing firmware.
>I have almost finished writing my code for my product, and my C++ library is nearly completed.  I aim to have my code in a production ready state by the end of December.

#### Finish designing my PCB and buy all of the components I need.
>I am also very close to finishing my PCB.  I may need to make another order so that I can have all of the improvements of my latest design.  I also have all of the parts that I need, assuming I am only building two SparkBots.  I am almost finished with this step.

#### Finish first fully working prototype.
>I want to have a fully working prototype by late February.  I will need to get all of my designs right.

#### Develop a website for my project and develop an app for controlling and monitoring my product.
>After I am done making my product, I will create a website for people to share code and designs, and an app for me to monitor and control my product.

#### Write a user manual and quick start guide.
>I want to write a proper documentation for my product.  I will make an online documentation as well as a paper documentation to have when I present my project.

#### Write my reflection.

> I need to write my reflection and talk about the following topics:

>* Why I am using GitHub over Google Drive.

>* Why I made my own PCB over using a breadboard.

>* Why I made my own website over the standard template.

>* Challenges.  PWMS, PCB, 3D Models
