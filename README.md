# Notes:

* Explain why I am using GitHub over Google Drive,
* Explain why I made my own PCB over using a Breadboard.
* Explain why I made my own website over the standard template.
* Talk about challenges.  PWMS, PCB, 3D Models

## Project:
* Explain why I am using GitHub over Google Drive.

## Website:
* Explain why I am using my own Website over Google Sites.
* Condense information on website, (break it into sections.)

## Reflection:
* Talk about challenges.  (Not enough PWMs, Designing my own PCB, Creating my 3D Models, Paying more for shipping than the components.)
* Comercial Aspect
