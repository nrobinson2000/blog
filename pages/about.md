# *Maker, Hacker, Student*:
I am 15 years old and I live in London, UK.  I love designing websites and programming.  I program C++ on my Arduinos and my Photons.  I write scripts in Bash, Phython and Expect.  I build websites in Node and made this Blog using Jekyll.  I love GitHub and Particle and use their tools everyday.  On my Linux Mint workstation I use Atom for all of my programming and plain-text editing.

# Interests:
* **Making things**: I am always involved in a project.  Right now I am in the middle of my grade 10 personal project.
* **Coding**: I try to code everyday and I always have Atom open on my machine, writing something.
* **Technology**: I love using Arduinos and Photons to create useful devices.  At my school I am the co-leader of the Technology Club.  This year we are building battle bots that will compete in our self-hosted tournament.
* **Freely Licensed Open-Source Software**: I use Mac for school but my prefer to use Linux whenever possible.  I built my own Linux gaming / work PC earlier this year.
* **Sports**: I play Volleyball, Basketball and Tennis on my school team.  I used do Archery and went shooting every weekend.
* **Cooking**: I like cooking for myself and my family because I enjoy following a recipe and making food.
* **Monstercat Music**: I have been listening to Monstercat for several months.  It inspires me to do great things.
* **Particle**: I have been supporting Particle since their first Kickstarter, and I have 10 Photons.  I am on their Forums and Slack I and I try to help other members when possible.

I created this Blog on 18/10/2015 after I found out about Jekyll.  This website is powered by Jekyll and is a repository on my GitHub account.  I am really liking Jekyll so far.  All I need to do is to write Markdown posts and Jekyll does the rest.  I am using Travis CI to test my blog, and I am hosting my blog on GitHub pages.  I think that Jekyll is the best blog platform that I have found.
