The Internet of Things is a new concept that is taking the world by force.  There will soon be more internet connected devices than there are people on this planet.  The Internet of Things, commonly referred to as IoT, is the name of the network of these internet connected devices.  The purpose of these devices is to use electronics, sensors, software and internet connectivity to collect, exchange, and act on data.  IoT devices fit into many fields and industries, as almost any electronic device can benefit from being internet-enabled.  Creating and using IoT devices has become more accessible, due to the lower prices and smaller sizes of electronic components, and the robustness of servers. A common application of IoT are Smart Homes, which are "smart" because they have appliances and sensors that make use of the Internet of Things.

The most critical part of any electronic product is a micro-controller.  Micro-controllers are relatively inexpensive electronic components that can be programmed to interact with circuits and obtain data from sensors, and are key for creating any kind of electronic device.  In order for the product to be considered an IoT device, the micro-controller must be connected to the internet via a type of antenna.  This antenna can either be Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or Cellular, as long as it can perform its function of connecting the device.

For my Personal Project I created an IoT product using two micro-controller boards, a Particle Photon and an Arduino Nano.  The Photon has Wi-Fi, and can be interacted with and monitored with the web application I created.  The Nano is controlled by the Photon over Serial, and can be given commands to control the servo motors and RGB LED connected to my custom printed circuit board.  Both the Photon and Nano run C++, and the application is written in Javascript.

For my Personal Project I created a cloud connected, wi-fi enabled Internet of Things device that uses a Particle Photon and Arduino Nano, two micro-controller boards, in conjunction with my app that I created to control and monitor motors, lights, a buzzer, and sensors over the internet. I created my project because I have been interested in electronics and the Internet of Things for the past two years.  Last year I bought several wi-fi enabled micro-controller boards from Particle and begun to use them to create simple devices that only had one purpose at a time.  This year I built a device that has many functions and serves multiple purposes for my personal project.

When the Grade 10 project officially began I decided I would have to make my project a bit different from the others.  I had already been using GitHub, a code sharing website that allows you to manage projects in special folders called repositories, to host my PCB designs and project planning documents, so I decided I would also create a repository for my project website because I am not fond of Google Sites's limited interface.  My website is powered by Jekyll, a program written in Ruby, that converts plaintext files written with Markdown formatting into sophisticated HTML files on the fly, meaning that I can spend more time writing content on my website than writing HTML code.  I also chose to use GitHub to host my three repositories related to my project because GitHub is more accessible and manageable than services like Google Drive or Dropbox.  I can access any of my files from any computer using the GitHub web interface or the terminal, and all of my files are organized in my repositories.  GitHub also has many integrations for repositories.  I test my repositories with Travis CI, a free service that can run tests for projects written in various programming languages.

I created my own PCB (printed circuit board) for my product in order to organize all of the different components in my product onto one board and so I would not have to use a breadboard in my final design.  I chose to design my PCB with a free app called Fritzing.  I originally tried to control all of the components with a Photon, but this did not work, as the Photon did not have enough pins to control all of the components on my board.  I realized this after the I made the third version of my board.  I was using three servo motors and an RGB, which require special pins that use Pulse Width Modulation, and Photons do not have six *usable* PWM pins.  I decided to incorporate another micro-controller board into my product to control the servos and RGB light of my product.  I decided to use the Arduino Nano because it is very similar to a Photon in size, but runs at five volt logic and has plenty of pins, meaning that it would work with my servos and RGB light.  In my fourth version of my board I added the Nano and rewired the servos and RGB to the it.  I bought a Nano on Amazon after ordering my board and I tested it with my Photon.  I was able to easily modify the code for my Photon for it to give commands to the Nano using Serial, a simple interface that uses a single wire for direct communication between micro-controllers. It was more difficult to program the Nano side of the wire.  I had to find a good way for the Nano to read a message received as a string of characters, save it as a string and parse it as a command.  Luckily, I was able to find a way make the Photon send simple commands like `rgb 255 000 000`. This command tells the Nano to turn on the red to maximum brightness and turn off the green and blue.  I had to make a function on the Photon that would always turn integers into three digit strings so that the position of the numbers in commands would always be the same.

I learned many things during my project.  Most importantly I learned the value of learning from mistakes.  Most of the mistakes I made during my project were with my PCB.  I had to design seven versions of my PCB, ordering five of them throughout my project.  With each board that had a mistake I found out why it wasn't working the way I intended, and I corrected the mistake in my design and prepared to order the next version.  My first board that I ordered was the worst.  It had a misplaced connection that made an unwanted connection between 3 volts and ground on the Photon, and I had to immediately order a replacement board.  The second board still had many mistakes, including incorrect pins.  The third board still had many errors, including PWM conflicts.  The fourth board fixed PWM conflicts, but the Photon still could not power all of the components of my product.  The fifth and final board that I ordered included an Arduino Nano and solved all of the problems I'd had with my previous boards.

In conclusion, I am satisfied with the outcome of my project.  I created a IoT device that works well.  It can be controlled using the app that I created to control motors, lights and a buzzer.  My app can also get data from the Photon, allowing it to monitor the amount of light being detected by the photoresistor or how much sound is being read from the microphone.  I improved my programming abilities during my project, as creating my app allowed me to improve my Javascript skills, and programming my Photon and Nano helped me teach myself C++.
